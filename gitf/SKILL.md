description: Personal Git Flow automation — invoke with /gitf to automatically handle the entire Git Flow lifecycle. Use this skill whenever the user types /gitf, wants to push a feature or fix branch to develop, wants to release to main, or needs help completing a Git Flow step. Detects current branch state and executes the appropriate flow end-to-end: feature/fix PR to develop, or full release to main with version bump and tagging. Fully automatic — creates PRs, merges them, pulls, tags, cleans up, all without waiting for confirmation. If branch protection blocks auto-merge, saves state and resumes on next /gitf call.

# /gitf — Personal Git Flow Automation

Fully automatic Git Flow execution. Detect state → decide path → execute end-to-end without pausing.

---

## Step 0: Check for saved state (ALWAYS run this first)

Before anything else:

```bash
cat .git/gitf-state.json 2>/dev/null
```

If the file exists → go to **FLOW RESUME** immediately. Skip all other detection.

If the file does not exist → proceed to **Step 1**.

---

## State file format

Saved at `.git/gitf-state.json` whenever a PR cannot be auto-merged. Deleted when the full flow completes.

```json
{
  "flow": "A",
  "step": "awaiting_merge",
  "pr_number": 3,
  "source_branch": "feature/auth-jwt",
  "target_branch": "develop",
  "version": null,
  "release_branch": null,
  "main_pr_merged": false,
  "develop_pr_number": null
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `flow` | A / B / C |
| `step` | `awaiting_merge` / `awaiting_merge_to_main` / `awaiting_merge_to_develop` |
| `pr_number` | The PR currently waiting |
| `source_branch` | Branch that was PR'd |
| `target_branch` | Base branch of the waiting PR |
| `version` | (Flow B/C only) version being released |
| `release_branch` | (Flow B/C only) e.g. `release/v1.2.0` |
| `main_pr_merged` | (Flow B only) whether release→main is done |
| `develop_pr_number` | (Flow B only) PR number for back-merge, once created |

---

## FLOW RESUME

Read `.git/gitf-state.json`, then check the waiting PR:

```bash
gh pr view <pr_number> --json state,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup
```

Evaluate the result:

| `state` | `mergeStateStatus` | Action |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| `MERGED` | — | PR is done → proceed to next step (see below) |
| `OPEN` | `BLOCKED` | Tell user: "PR #N is still waiting for review. Merge it on GitHub, then run /gitf again." |
| `OPEN` | `UNSTABLE` | Tell user: "CI failed on PR #N. Fix the failing checks, then run /gitf again." |
| `OPEN` | `UNKNOWN` or checks pending | Tell user: "CI is still running on PR #N. Wait for it to finish, then run /gitf again." |
| `CLOSED` (not merged) | — | Tell user: "PR #N was closed without merging. Run /gitf again to start fresh." → delete state file |

### What "next step" means per flow and step:

**Flow A — `awaiting_merge`** (feature/fix → develop):
- PR merged → `git checkout develop && git pull origin develop`
- Delete `.git/gitf-state.json`
- Report: done

**Flow B — `awaiting_merge_to_main`** (release → main):
- PR merged → tag main:
  ```bash
  git checkout main && git pull origin main
  git tag -a v<version> -m "v<version>"
  git push origin v<version>
  ```
- Create back-merge PR (release → develop), attempt auto-merge
- If auto-merge succeeds → cleanup, delete state
- If blocked → update state: `step=awaiting_merge_to_develop`, save `develop_pr_number`

**Flow B — `awaiting_merge_to_develop`** (back-merge → develop):
- PR merged → cleanup:
  ```bash
  git checkout develop && git pull origin develop
  git branch -d <release_branch> 2>/dev/null || true
  ```
- Delete `.git/gitf-state.json`
- Report: full release summary

**Flow C — `awaiting_merge`** (hotfix → main or → develop):
- Same pattern as Flow B, using `target_branch` from state to know which step

---

## Step 1: Detect current state

Run in parallel:

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --short
git log develop..HEAD --oneline
git log main..develop --oneline
git remote -v
```

---

## Decision Tree

```
/gitf triggered
│
├── .git/gitf-state.json exists? → FLOW RESUME (above)
│
├── On feature/* or fix/*
│   └── → FLOW A
│
├── On hotfix/*
│   └── → FLOW C
│
├── On release/*
│   └── → FLOW B (resume in-progress release without state file)
│
├── On develop
│   ├── uncommitted changes → FLOW D, Case 1
│   ├── commits ahead of origin/develop → FLOW D, Case 2
│   ├── develop ahead of main → FLOW B
│   └── develop == main → "develop and main are in sync, nothing to release"
│
└── On main → warn: "You're on main — should not be working here directly"
```

---

## FLOW A: Feature/Fix → Develop

```bash
# 1. Push
git push -u origin <current-branch>

# 2. Create PR
gh pr create --base develop \
  --title "<conventional commits title from branch/commits>" \
  --body "<summarize commits>"

# 3. Attempt auto-merge
gh pr view <number> --json mergeStateStatus,state
```

If `mergeStateStatus == CLEAN` → merge immediately:
```bash
gh pr merge <number> --merge --delete-branch
git checkout develop && git pull origin develop
```

If blocked (BLOCKED / UNSTABLE / checks pending) → save state:
```bash
# Write .git/gitf-state.json
{
  "flow": "A",
  "step": "awaiting_merge",
  "pr_number": <number>,
  "source_branch": "<current-branch>",
  "target_branch": "develop",
  "version": null,
  "release_branch": null,
  "main_pr_merged": false,
  "develop_pr_number": null
}
```
Tell user what's blocking and to run `/gitf` after it's resolved.

**PR title convention**: derive from branch name and commits.
- `feature/auth-jwt` → `feat(auth): implement JWT authentication`
- `fix/map-markers` → `fix(map): correct marker positioning`

---

## FLOW B: Full Release to Main

### B-1: Detect version file

Check in order:
1. `package.json` — if `.ts/.js/.tsx/.jsx` files exist
2. `pyproject.toml` — if `.py` is the main language
3. `Cargo.toml` — if `.rs` is the main language
4. `VERSION` — fallback; create with `0.1.0` if none found

Determine bump from `git log main..develop --oneline`:
- Only `fix:` commits → patch
- Any `feat:` commit → minor
- `BREAKING CHANGE` in any commit body → major (ask user to confirm before proceeding)

### B-2: Create release branch and bump version

```bash
git checkout develop && git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v<new-version>
# Edit version file (only the version field)
git add <version-file>
git commit -m "chore: bump version to v<new-version>"
git push -u origin release/v<new-version>
```

### B-3: PR release → main

```bash
gh pr create --base main \
  --title "release: v<new-version>" \
  --body "Release v<new-version>

Changes since last release:
$(git log main..HEAD --oneline --no-merges)"

gh pr view <number> --json mergeStateStatus,state
```

If `CLEAN` → merge, then tag:
```bash
gh pr merge <number> --merge
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git tag -a v<new-version> -m "v<new-version>"
git push origin v<new-version>
```
Then proceed to B-4.

If blocked → save state:
```json
{
  "flow": "B",
  "step": "awaiting_merge_to_main",
  "pr_number": <number>,
  "source_branch": "release/v<new-version>",
  "target_branch": "main",
  "version": "<new-version>",
  "release_branch": "release/v<new-version>",
  "main_pr_merged": false,
  "develop_pr_number": null
}
```

### B-4: PR release → develop (back-merge)

After tagging, the current branch is `main`. Must explicitly specify `--head` so GitHub uses the release branch, not main:

```bash
gh pr create --base develop \
  --head release/v<new-version> \
  --title "chore: back-merge release v<new-version> into develop" \
  --body "Brings version bump commit from release/v<new-version> back to develop"

gh pr view <number> --json mergeStateStatus,state
```

If `CLEAN` → merge and clean up:
```bash
gh pr merge <number> --merge
git push origin --delete release/v<new-version>
git checkout develop && git pull origin develop
git branch -d release/v<new-version> 2>/dev/null || true
```
Delete `.git/gitf-state.json`. Report full release summary.

If blocked → update state:
```json
{
  "flow": "B",
  "step": "awaiting_merge_to_develop",
  "pr_number": <develop-pr-number>,
  "source_branch": "release/v<new-version>",
  "target_branch": "develop",
  "version": "<new-version>",
  "release_branch": "release/v<new-version>",
  "main_pr_merged": true,
  "develop_pr_number": <number>
}
```

### B-5: Final confirmation (after cleanup)

```
✓ Released v<new-version>
  • release/v<new-version> merged to main
  • Tagged v<new-version> on main
  • Version bump back-merged to develop
  • Release branch deleted (local + remote)
  • develop and main are now in sync
```

---

## FLOW C: Hotfix

```bash
git push -u origin <hotfix-branch>

# PR to main
gh pr create --base main --title "hotfix: <description>" --body "..."
# Check mergeStateStatus, save state if blocked (same pattern as Flow A)
gh pr merge <number> --merge

# Tag
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git tag -a v<bumped-patch> -m "v<bumped-patch>"
git push origin v<bumped-patch>

# PR to develop
gh pr create --base develop --title "hotfix: back-merge <description> to develop" --body "..."
# Check mergeStateStatus, save state if blocked
gh pr merge <number> --merge --delete-branch

git checkout develop && git pull origin develop
git branch -d <hotfix-branch>
```

---

## FLOW D: Rescue — AI Forgot to Branch

**Case 1 — uncommitted changes on develop:**
```bash
git checkout -b <inferred-branch>
# Changes carry over automatically
```
Then FLOW A.

**Case 2 — rogue commits on develop:**
```bash
git checkout -b <inferred-branch>   # at current HEAD
git checkout develop
git reset --hard origin/develop
git checkout <inferred-branch>
```
Then FLOW A.

**Branch naming**: infer from commit messages and changed files. Format: `feature/<scope>-<kebab-desc>` or `fix/<scope>-<kebab-desc>`. Tell the user the chosen name and why.

---

## Rules

- Never commit directly to `develop` or `main`
- `feature/*` and `fix/*` always branch from develop, never from main
- Merge type is always merge commit (`--merge`)
- Tag immediately after merge to main, before back-merge to develop
- Delete release/feature/fix branches after flow completes (local and remote)
- Check `mergeStateStatus` before attempting `gh pr merge` — never blindly call merge and hope it works
- Delete `.git/gitf-state.json` only when the entire flow is fully complete
- If `gh` is not authenticated or a PR creation fails, stop and report the error clearly
