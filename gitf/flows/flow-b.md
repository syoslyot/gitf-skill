# Flow B — Full Release to Main

**Trigger**: on `develop` with commits ahead of `main`, or resuming on an
existing `release/*` branch.

Steps marked **[version only]** run only when `-v` was passed (`VERSION_MODE=true`).
Everything here except `LAND` is platform-independent — version detection,
bumping, and tagging are plain git.

### B-1: Determine release name

**[version only]**: read the version file (order below), determine the bump from
commit history, compute the new version. Release branch = `release/v<new-version>`.

**[no version]**: release branch = `release/<YYYY-MM-DD>`. If that name already
exists, append `-2`, `-3`, …

Version file detection order:
1. `package.json` (if `.ts/.js/.tsx/.jsx` files exist)
2. `pyproject.toml` (if `.py` is primary)
3. `Cargo.toml` (if `.rs` is primary)
4. `VERSION` (fallback — create with `0.1.0` if none found)

Bump type from `git log main..develop --oneline`:
- only `fix:` → patch
- any `feat:` → minor
- `BREAKING CHANGE` in body → major (confirm with user first)

### B-2: Create release branch

```bash
git checkout develop && git pull   # SYNC develop first if has_remote
git checkout -b <release-branch>
```

### B-3 [version only]: Bump version file

Edit only the version field:
- `package.json` → `"version": "<new-version>"`
- `pyproject.toml` / `Cargo.toml` → `version = "<new-version>"`
- `VERSION` → overwrite

```bash
git add <version-file>
git commit -m "chore: bump version to v<new-version>"
```

### B-4: Code-review gate

Run the shared code-review gate (`flows/code-review-gate.md`) on
`<release-branch>` against `main..<release-branch>`. If it stops with unresolved
findings, state is saved (`step=awaiting_code_review`) and the run halts here;
otherwise continue to B-5.

### B-5: Land release → main

`PUBLISH <release-branch>` then `LAND base=main head=<release-branch> keep-branch`.

`keep-branch` is required — the release branch is still needed for the
back-merge in B-7.

- github: if blocked, state is saved (`step=awaiting_merge_to_main`,
  `main_pr_merged=false`) → stop.
- local: synchronous merge into main, push main if `has_remote`.

### B-6 [version only]: Tag main

`TAG <new-version>` — only after main has the release commit, never before B-5,
never after B-7.

### B-7: Land release → develop (back-merge)

`LAND base=develop head=<release-branch>` (no `keep-branch` — done with it after).

- github: must create the back-merge PR with `--head <release-branch>` (current
  branch may be `main`). If blocked, update state
  (`step=awaiting_merge_to_develop`, `main_pr_merged=true`) → stop.
- local: synchronous merge into develop, push if `has_remote`.

### B-8: Cleanup

`CLEANUP <release-branch>` → `SYNC develop` → delete `.gitf/state.json`
(github) → **status-messages: flow-b-done**.

**Tag ordering invariant**: always between B-5 (main has the commit) and B-7.
